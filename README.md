# Banking-Risk-Analytics-Dashboard


This project harnesses data analytics to enhance risk management in banking and financial services. By developing a dynamic Power BI dashboard, I provide deep insights into banking operations, helping financial institutions mitigate risks associated with lending.

The banking industry often faces challenges in minimizing the risk of financial losses when extending credit to customers. The objective of this project is to utilize detailed analytics to assess and manage these risks effectively.

The Power BI dashboard leverages a comprehensive dataset encompassing various aspects of banking operations, such as account types, client demographics, and transaction details. It enables decision-makers to evaluate the creditworthiness of applicants efficiently and make informed lending decisions.

## Features:
The dashboard integrates comprehensive banking data, presenting it through interactive Power BI visualizations that allow for in-depth analysis of client relationships, transaction details, and credit risks. It features a range of advanced metrics and KPIs like total loans, deposits, and fees, alongside risk assessment tools to evaluate creditworthiness and financial exposures efficiently. This setup provides decision-makers with the actionable insights needed to navigate the complexities of financial risk management effectively.

## Technologies Used:
Utilized Power BI for dashboard visualizations and SQL for robust data management and querying.
